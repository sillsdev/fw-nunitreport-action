## Initial Setup

After you've cloned the repository to your local machine or codespace, you'll
need to perform some initial setup steps before you can develop your action.

> [!NOTE]
>
> You'll need to have a reasonably modern version of
> [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) handy (20.x or later should work!). If you are
> using a version manager like [`nodenv`](https://github.com/nodenv/nodenv) or
> [`nvm`](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm), this template has a `.node-version`
> file at the root of the repository that will be used to automatically switch
> to the correct version when you `cd` into the repository. Additionally, this
> `.node-version` file is used by GitHub Actions in any `actions/setup-node`
> actions.

1. :hammer_and_wrench: Install the dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

1. :building_construction: Package the TypeScript for distribution

   ```bash
   npm run bundle
   ```

1. :white_check_mark: Run the tests

   ```bash
   npm test
   ```

## Publishing a new version

1. Create a new branch

   ```bash
   git checkout -b releases/v1
   ```

1. Make your changes
1. Add or change tests in `__tests__/`
1. Format, test, and build the action

   ```bash
   npm run all
   ```

   > [!WARNING]
   >
   > This step is important! It will run [`ncc`](https://github.com/vercel/ncc)
   > to build the final JavaScript action code with all dependencies included.
   > If you do not run this step, your action will not work correctly when it is
   > used in a workflow. This step also includes the `--license` option for
   > `ncc`, which will create a license file for all of the production node
   > modules used in your project.

1. Commit your changes
1. Push them to your repository

   ```bash
   git push -u origin releases/v1
   ```

1. Create a pull request and get feedback on your action
1. Merge the pull request into the `main` branch

The action is now published! :rocket:

## Usage

After testing, you can create version tag(s) that developers can use to
reference different stable versions of your action. For more information, see
[Versioning](https://github.com/actions/toolkit/blob/master/docs/action-versioning.md)
in the GitHub Actions toolkit.

To include the action in a workflow in another repository, you can use the
`uses` syntax with the `@` symbol to reference a specific branch, tag, or commit
hash.

### NUnit Text Format

```yaml
steps:
  - name: Report Results
    id: test-result-action
    uses: sillsdev/fw-nunitreport-action@v1 # Commit with the `v1` tag
    with:
      log-path: /path/to/nunitreporteroutput
      token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
      encoding: utf-16le # optional tuning to match the output filetype for the runner
```

### TRX Format (Visual Studio Test Results)

This action now supports reading Visual Studio Test Results (.trx) files. The
format is automatically detected based on the file extension or content.

```yaml
steps:
  - name: Report Results
    id: test-result-action
    uses: sillsdev/fw-nunitreport-action@v1 # Commit with the `v1` tag
    with:
      log-path: /path/to/testresults.trx
      token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
      encoding: utf-8 # TRX files are typically UTF-8 encoded
```

## Publishing a New Release

This project includes a helper script, [`script/release`](./script/release)
designed to streamline the process of tagging and pushing new releases for
GitHub Actions.

GitHub Actions allows users to select a specific version of the action to use,
based on release tags. This script simplifies this process by performing the
following steps:

1. **Retrieving the latest release tag:** The script starts by fetching the most
   recent release tag by looking at the local data available in your repository.
1. **Prompting for a new release tag:** The user is then prompted to enter a new
   release tag. To assist with this, the script displays the latest release tag
   and provides a regular expression to validate the format of the new tag.
1. **Tagging the new release:** Once a valid new tag is entered, the script tags
   the new release.
1. **Pushing the new tag to the remote:** Finally, the script pushes the new tag
   to the remote repository. From here, you will need to create a new release in
   GitHub and users can easily reference the new tag in their workflows.
